# Rhino Africa Preview 
### For this project I was given an [CSV File](https://github.com/Bgoldberg44/rhino_africa_python/blob/main/inquiries_mini.csv) for the company [Rhino Africa Safaris](https://www.rhinoafrica.com/en?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=%5Ba%3ARIA%5D%5Bc%3AUSA%5D%5Bl%3AEN%5D%5Bn%3AGSN%5D%5Bc%3ABrand%5D%5Bt%3APure%5D&utm_id=18146443320&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=18146443320&gbraid=0AAAAAD9Q8khF6ZP8zxgoyRHDOhB0HzpLe&gclid=Cj0KCQiAgbnKBhDgARIsAGCDdlfZ0n3D6aw1o0MFiqb37wWXTLpnIo7ZfA3p5AYbgXvPr9X7yBvphsgaAtgmEALw_wcB)


 - My goal for this project was to create 2 seperate Python scripts, one being a custom [Module Script](https://github.com/Bgoldberg44/rhino_africa_python/blob/main/annotated-my_rhino_goldberg.py.pdf) and the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Bgoldberg44/rhino_africa_python/blob/main/assignment1_goldberg_benjamin.ipynb) script calling each of the functions that were created in the module script. The main thing I learned with this project was connecting and organizing more than one script for data analysis

### Section 1: Data Loading and Overview — Commentary

- This data represents customer inquiries. The datset includes the customers id, country, number of adults and children, the budget, and travel month. The values I just stated we will be analzying later in this project. This first section loads the module script into the jupyter notebook. The section also loads the inquiries_mini.csv. The second function that is used is the print_data_summary. This function returns the total records, columns, and each column name.

### Geographic Patterns Commentary
- Inquiries are concentrated in a few English-speaking markets. The United States leads with 14221 inquiries, followed by the United Kingdom 9069 inquiries and South Africa 8995 inquiries. Australia and Canada are next. This suggests strong brand reach in North America, the UK, and the Southern African region, with room to grow in continental Europe and Asia. I was suprised with the number of South Africa inquries because of the proximity to other African nations

### Budget Patterns Commentary
- The average budget tells us roughly the amount we need to prepare for each inquiry, this can be used as the typical price for a budget. Additionally, using the min operator we can use this for quoting. For example, we could say on our website "Starting from $4,000" Since we use the mini_inquries csv file we have a 100 percent completion rate. We can draw insights such as the rough amount of capital we need to save to support the budget.

### Travel Timing Commentary
- Travel interest peaks in the middle of the year: July is highest, followed by August and June, May and September also strong. This aligns with Southern Africa’s dry season (roughly May–October), when wildlife viewing is best and many travelers have summer holidays. Lower interest in November–March may reflect wetter conditions and fewer school breaks.

### Customer Behavior Commentary
- Our completion rate tells us how many inquries we still need to complete this is important to track because this gives us an estimate for our conversion rate. The group size that is the most common is the Couple category. This information for marketing and operations because we know our target audience (who to market towards) and operations (who we can tailor our itineraries for). An example would be adding romantic itineraries such as honeymoons to better match our couple target audience.

## Summary and Conclusions
- Overall, our strongest demand comes from North america followed by South Africa. Our budget analysis gives us a good idea of our costs and pricing. Our peak season is June- September matching the classic safari timing.

- Some recommendations i have: Our inventory and marketing should favor our peak season months, our target audience are couples and families so we could create a honeymoon/romatic safari themes and family oriented themes. We also need to work on getting a higher form completion rate so working on that would help.
